# microbit-chrome
Prototype chrome addon that exposes the micro:bit's serial output to webpages.

# Installation
Until I put this up on the Chrome App Store, see
[developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)
for instructions on how to install the local version into your chrome browser.

# Requirements
You need Chrome 48 (Canary) for this to work on Windows. This may work on other
platforms with Chrome 46.
